Meeting time: 9/11/2018, 18:00-18:50
People: all group members + 2 costumers.

We will have to implement 7 features. 5 of them are: public viewing pages, login, maintenance request, online one-to-one chating 

login: we will have residence login and manager login. 
	There are two possible approaches: 
		1. residence accounts and manager accounts are in separated systems. A person will have two accounts if he is both a residence and a manager.
		2. an account will be granted different privileges depends on the roles of the owner. I.e. an account will have both the residence’s and manager’s privilege if the owner is both a residence and a manager.

public viewing pages: these pages will display the floor plan, rent rate and address etc. It should also provide a way to contact the managers & submit an rent application.

maintenance request: a residence can send the manager a maintenance request. There should be some per-defined frame for the residence to specify the issue. i.e. AC, water, power and so on.

online one-to-one chatting: a residence should be able to chat with a manager online. A manager may also be able to chat with another manager.

payment: residence can make a payment or setup a auto-payment.

Possible additional features:

Online post board: residence can push a post online so other residence could see it.
Notification: managers can issue a notification to some particular or all of the residence. 
utility fee service: the residence can choose to pay a flat utility fee or actual usage fee.
